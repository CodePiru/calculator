# calculator

This project was mostly made in my phone with TrebEdit App, that's why it doesn't have many commits.

The max number input for one value is a string of 8 digits (including decimal and minus)
The max display result is a string of 10 digits (including decimal and minus)
All decimal values are rounded to 2 digits
The +/- key, can't be applied to results, just inputted values
